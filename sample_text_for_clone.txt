Computer security, also cybersecurity or information technology security, is the protection of computer systems and networks from attack by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. The field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things. Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary world due to the complexity of information systems both in terms of political and technological issues. Its primary goal is to ensure the system's dependability, integrity, and data privacy.

Risk management of information technology involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events. This includes hardening operating systems, securing endpoints, configuring intrusion detection systems, enforcing least privilege access, patching software vulnerabilities, and implementing multi-factor authentication. In addition to preventive measures, resilient organizations develop comprehensive incident response plans, conduct tabletop exercises, and practice restoring operations from clean backups.

The evolving landscape of cyber threats includes ransomware that encrypts an organization's data, supply chain compromises that inject malicious code into trusted software updates, and advanced persistent threats backed by nation-state capabilities. Defenders are increasingly adopting zero trust architectures, continuous behavioral analytics, automated threat intelligence, and machine learning-driven detection algorithms to reduce dwell time and contain breaches before sensitive data is exfiltrated. Ultimately, cultivating a culture of security awareness among users remains a critical pillar, since human error continues to be leveraged by phishing campaigns and social engineering attacks.
